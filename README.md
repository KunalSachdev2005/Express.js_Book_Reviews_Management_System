# Online Book Review Application

This repository contains the server-side implementation of an Online Book Review application, developed using Node.js and Express.js. This project demonstrates the practical application of back-end development skills, focusing on RESTful APIs, CRUD operations, authentication, asynchronous programming, and using node package manager (npm).

## Overview
The Online Book Review application is designed to manage book reviews for an online bookstore. It provides a RESTful API for managing books and reviews, allowing multiple users to interact with the system simultaneously. Authentication ensures that only authorized users can perform certain operations, such as adding, editing, or deleting reviews.

## Features
1. Retrieve a list of all books in the bookstore.
2. Search books by ISBN, author names, or titles.
3. Retrieve reviews for specific books.
4. User registration and login.
5. Add, modify, and delete book reviews (logged-in users only).
6. Concurrent user interactions using asynchronous programming.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side programming.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For user authentication and authorization.
- **Session Authentication**: To manage user sessions securely.
- **Axios**: For HTTP requests.
- **Postman**: For API testing.
- **Async/Await and Promises**: To handle asynchronous operations.
